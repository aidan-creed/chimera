# CHIMERA PRIVACY POLICY
**Last Updated:** 10/5/2025

## Overview
Chimera is an analytics platform for EVE Online that processes public game data and user-authorized character information.  This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data. 

## Data We Collect
### Public Game Data
We automatically collect and store publicly available EVE Online data including:
- Market Orders and pricing from the ESI API
- Killmal data from zKillboard
- Static game data (ship statistics, item properties, etc.)
- Corporation and alliance public information
This data is cached locally to improve peformance and reduce load on public APIs.

### User Account Data
When you authenticate with EVE SSO, we store:
- Character name and ID
- Corporation and alliance affiliation
- Email address (if provided via ESI)

### ESI Permissions
Depending on the features you use, we may request ESI scopes to access:
- Character assets and wallet data (for personal portfolio tracking)
- Industry jobs and transactions (for profit tracking)
You can revoke these permissions at any time through EVE's third-party [application management](https://developers.eveonline.com/authorized-apps)

### Usage Analytics
We collect:
- Query history (what questions you ask the AI)
- Feature usage patterns (which tools you use)
- Performance metrics (response times, error rates)
- Browser/device information (for compatibility)
We do NOT collect:
- Real-world personal information beyond what EVE SSO provides
- Voice or Video data

## How We Use Your Data
### Service Operation
- Process your queries and provide analysis
- Generate automated reports and alerts
- Improve AI model responses
- Debug technical issues

### Security
- Detect abuse or suspicious activity

## Data Sharing
We do NOT:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Share your character data with other users
- Provide your query history to anyone else
- Use your data for advertising
We MAY share anonymized, aggregated statistics publicly (e.g., "10,000 market queries processed today") but never individual user data.

## Data Retention
- **Public game data:** Retained indefinitely for historical analysis
- **User queries:** Retained for 90 days, then aggregated/anonymized
- **Character data:** Retained while your account is active
- **ESI tokens:** Refreshed automatically, revocable via EVE SSO

## Your Rights
You can:
- Request a copy of all the data we hold about you
- Request deletion of your account and associated data
- Revoke ESI permissios at any time
- Opt our of usage analytics (with reduced functionality)
Contact [tbd] to exercise these rights.

## Security
We implement industry-standard security practices:
- Encrypted data transmissions (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure credential storage
- Regular security audits
- Access logging and monitoring
However, no system is perfectly secure. We will notify you promptly of any data breach affecting your account. 

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as features evolve. Material changes will be announced via in-game mail or the project Discord. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Open Source Transparency
The Chimera platform code is open source. You can audit our data handling practices at [TBD]. While the code is public, the production database containing user data is private and secured.
